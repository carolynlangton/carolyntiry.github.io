I'm a fourth-semester software developer student at [Northcentral Technical College](https://www.ntc.edu/programs-courses/all/associate-degrees/IT-software-developer) in Wausau, Wis.

I used to be in the media industry (I worked as a reporter at a small daily newspaper), but after realizing that wasn't for me, I set out to remake myself into a software developer by taking classes at the local technical college.

You can find a record of all my blog posts in the [archive]({{ site.url }}/archive) and a listing of my professional qualifications on my [resume]({{ site.url}}/resume).

## Odds and ends

Some fun facts about me:

* I'm a bit of a soccer fanatic. I could talk about it all day, even if it's not about my team, Liverpool FC. Go Reds!
* I studied abroad at the University of Winchester in the fall of 2010. It led to some of the best experiences of my life.
* One of my life goals is to visit every national park in the US. I only have five crossed off the list so far, so I've got plenty of adventuring left to do.
* I'm born and bred in central Wisconsin (Amherst, to be specific), but my heart lies in Eau Claire, the city of my post-secondary education.
* I make a mean carrot cake. Just ask my fiance.
