### [Library inventory manager](https://github.com/carolyntiry/library-inventory-app)
This Windows desktop application allows users to enter data associated with a library, including books, individual copies of books, authors, genres, formats and members.

It also allows both administrators and members to log in using encrypted credentials. In addition to data entry, administrators can check out and return books for members. Members can check out books and view their transaction history.

The application was written using C#, WPF, Entity Framework, and the model-view-view model architectural pattern. It was built in conjunction with two classmates as the final project of the Software Architecture class in the Software Developer associate's degree at Northcentral Technical College.

### [Assignment instructions]({{ site.url }}/instruction-list)
My responsibilities as an instructional assistant at Northcentral Technical College includes writing detailed assignment instructions for a few of the C# programming classes. I have written in-depth tutorials for the assignments in the third-semester Software Architecture class, and I have walked the line between giving too much detail and allowing room for exploration when writing assignments for the second-semester Object-Oriented Programming 2 class.

In addition, I have invented entire scenarios for assignments in three database classes &mdash; Database Concepts, Database Design & SQL and Database Reporting.

Check out [some examples]({{ site.url }}/instruction-list) of assignments I've written.
